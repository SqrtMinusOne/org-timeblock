You can press ~[t]~ to toggle the display of org-timeblock-list-mode
buffer.  Foreground colors for timeblocks are generated randomly, but
you can assign specific background and foreground colors in
customizable variable ~org-timeblock-tag-colors~:

You can switch to a multi-day view using ~ot-switch-view [V]~:

The builtin orgmode package for viewing tasks or events for a
particular day, org-agenda, does not help you to quickly understand,
where, for example, you have free time in your day or where you have
overlapping tasks.  Just a list of tasks is not sufficient.  This
package is created to fix this problem and provide some of the
functionality that modern calendars provide.

There are two major modes provided by the package:

- ~org-timeblock-mode~.  Displays visual schedule (timeblocks) of org
  tasks that are scheduled or have an active timestamp in their body
  (orgmode events) for selected day (Currently, only day view is available).  Available commands:
  - org-timeblock-day-earlier/later ~[C-<down>/<up>]~
  - org-timeblock-set-duration ~[d]~
  - org-timeblock-reschedule ~[s]~
  - org-timeblock-new-task ~[+]~
  - org-timeblock-toggle-timeblock-list ~[t]~
  - org-timeblock-clock-in ~[i]~ (to clock out, press ~o~)
  - org-timeblock-todo ~[1]~
  - org-timeblock-done ~[5]~
  - org-timeblock-switch-scaling ~[v]~
  - org-timeblock-switch-view ~[V]~
  - org-timeblock-write ~[w]~
  - org-timeblock-jump-to-day ~[j]~
  - org-timeblock-todo-set ~[T]~

- ~org-timeblock-list-mode~.  Displays a list of org tasks that are
  scheduled or orgmode events for selected day.  It's sort of like a
  light org-agenda.  The tasks can be sorted via ~SCHEDULED~ org
  property or manually placed by user via commands
  ~org-timeblock-list-drag-line-forward/backward [M-<up>/<down>]~.  The
  order can be saved in a cache file via ~org-timeblock-list-save
  [C-s]~ command.  The sorting algorithm can be changed via
  ~org-timeblock-list-toggle-sort-function [S]~ command.
  - org-timeblock-list-schedule ~[s]~
  - org-timeblock-list-set-duration ~[d]~
  - org-timeblock-todo ~[1]~
  - org-timeblock-done ~[5]~
  - org-timeblock-list-drag-line-forward/backward ~[M-<down>/<up>]~
  - org-timeblock-list-toggle-sort-function ~[S]~
  - org-timeblock-list-clock-in ~[i]~ (to clock out, press ~o~)
  - org-timeblock-switch-scaling ~[v]~
  - org-timeblock-switch-view ~[V]~
  - org-timeblock-list-toggle-timeblock ~[t]~
  - org-timeblock-todo-set ~[T]~

#+end_src

2. Then, run ~guix pull~.
3. Now you can install the package.

** Quelpa

1. Install ~quelpa-use-package~ (which can be installed directly from MELPA).
2. Add this form to your init file:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-timeblock
  :quelpa (org-timeblock :fetcher github :repo "ichernyshovvv/org-timeblock"))
#+end_src

** Straight

Add this form to your init file:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-timeblock
  :straight (org-timeblock :type git
              :host github
              :repo "ichernyshovvv/org-timeblock"))
#+end_src

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: usage
:END:

To enter ~org-timeblock-list-mode~, run ~M-x org-timeblock-list~.  To
enter ~org-timeblock-mode~, run ~M-x org-timeblock~

For both modes, the default date is today.  All the tasks and events
are searched in ~(org-agenda-files)~.  You can change the displayed
date via the following commands:

- org-timeblock-day-later ~[C-<down>]~
- org-timeblock-day-earlier ~[C-<up>]~
- org-timeblock-jump-to-day ~[j]~

To navigate between tasks/blocks, use these commands:

- org-timeblock-list-mode
  - org-timeblock-list-previous-line ~[<up>]~
  - org-timeblock-list-next-line ~[<down>]~
- org-timeblock-mode
  - org-timeblock-forward-block ~[<down>]~
  - org-timeblock-bacward-block ~[<up>]~

In both modes, you can navigate via mouse clicks to select an entry or
a block.

To reschedule or change the duration of a task at point, use these
commands:

- org-timeblock-list-mode
  - org-timeblock-list-schedule ~[s]~
  - org-timeblock-list-set-duration ~[d]~
- org-timeblock-mode
  - org-timeblock-schedule ~[s]~
